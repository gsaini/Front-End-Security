CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines whether to block or fulfill requests for restricted resources on a web page from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

The same-origin security policy forbids "cross-domain" requests by default. CORS gives web servers cross-domain access controls, which enable secure cross-domain data transfers.
